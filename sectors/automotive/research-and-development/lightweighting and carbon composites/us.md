We are the world leader in automotive lightweighting. In 2015, we provided £40 million of R&D funding to make vehicles lighter and more energy-efficient.

The [National Composites Centre](http://nccuk.com/) is dedicated to investigating low weight carbon composites, whilst the [Affordable Composites Group](http://www.nccuk.com/ncc-news/affordable-composites-group-help-uk-exploit-booming-global-market-low-cost-high-volume) are working with the Automotive Investment Organisation (AIO) to engage overseas companies in collaborative R&D.

Private companies are also investing in making cars lighter and faster. Jaguar Land Rover, based in the Midlands, is the world’s most revolutionary aluminium car manufacturer. The company’s UK factory is currently developing an all-new aluminium monocoque vehicle architecture that will reduce fuel consumption and increase crash safety.
