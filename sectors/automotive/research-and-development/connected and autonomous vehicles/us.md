In XXX, we created the [Centre for Connected and Autonomous Vehicles](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/driverless-vehicles-connected-and-autonomous-technologies) to ensure that we remain a world leader in developing and testing connected autonomous vehicles. We have awarded the centre £200 million to fund R&D opportunities and to play a pivotal role in influencing policy development in the industry.

And, given the global eagerness for driverless cars, we have permissive regulations to ensure that R&D departments find it easy to test their vehicles.
