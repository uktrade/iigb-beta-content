The UK automotive industry is known for its innovative ideas and thriving research and development centres. The £1 billion [Advanced Propulsion Centre](http://www.apcuk.co.uk/) is a global centre for excellence in low carbon propulsion technologies, whilst the [National Composites Centre](http://nccuk.com/) specialises in the development of low weight carbon composites. 

This thinking is supported by the [Automotive Council](http://www.automotivecouncil.co.uk/), which works with the government and automotive leaders to implement a long-term strategy focused on skills development, improving the competitiveness of the UK supply chain and supporting emerging and disruptive technologies.
