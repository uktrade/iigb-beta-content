The UK benefits from a supportive business environment that offers the most competitive and flexible labour market in western Europe. This helps make sure that workers in the UK car industry add more value per car than anywhere else on the continent.  

A number of automotive businesses benefit from being part of two of the UK’s strongest regional hubs. 

- The Northern Powerhouse hosts some of the biggest names in the industry, with General Motors, Nissan and Jaguar Land Rover all having plants in the region.
- The Midlands Engine is home to top class motor racing facilities such as Silverstone, Milbrook and MIRA, as well as major component manufacturers and 
world-renowned R&D centres.
- 25% of all electric car manufacturing happens in UK
- 9 out of the 11 Formula 1 teams have a base in the UK
- 77% of UK-built cars are exported to more than 100 countries
