We are committed to creating a world-leading framework for technology innovation by offering a wealth of world-class start-up programmes to support embryonic technology businesses and entrepreneurs.

In the 2015 budget we announced £140 million would be invested in world-class research on the infrastructure and cities of the future, and £40 million in research into the internet of things (IoT).

InnovateUK is the UK’s Innovation Agency and supports collaborative technology development programmes for large and small companies to work together and with universities.

They have also set up 10 Catapult Centres, which form a community of practice, designed to transform our capability for innovation and help drive future economic growth.

The Digital Catapult is a focal point to push our best digital ideas to market. It provides a space to work, meet, and collaborate for entrepreneurs, small businesses, researchers, and corporate organisations. We have set up similar Catapults at other areas such as Future Cities, Satellite Communications, and Transport Systems.

We also have initiatives to support early-stage companies, which include:

- Smart Awards targeted at proof of market, concept and prototype studies
- IC Tomorrow, which focuses on themes such as augmented reality, wearables and data analytics

An investment of £42 million created a national institute for data science. The Alan Turing Institute (named after the pioneering computer scientist and code breaker)  represents a partnership with 5 leading universities in the field of data science: Cambridge, Edinburgh, Oxford, University College London (UCL) and Warwick.
