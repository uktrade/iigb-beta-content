Fintech investment deal volumes in the UK have been growing at an average 74 percent a year since 2008, compared with 27 percent globally and 13 percent in Silicon Valley.

Four especially strong sub sectors are:

-	payments -  currently transforming and attracting a wide range of innovators
-	platforms - particularly peer-to-peer lending, trading, personal wealth management and aggregators
-	software - for example risk management, payments, asset management, capital markets, insurance and accounting
-	data Analytics - for example credit reference, capital markets and insurance

Annual revenue generated across the 4 areas is around £20 billion.

There is ample room in the market for established providers and disruptive technologies, and many different sources of finance are available. The sector is well served by angel and private equity investors, accelerator and incubator schemes.
 
Innovations are supported by its excellent IT and transport infrastructure, and one of the highest levels of internet and mobile penetration globally.
