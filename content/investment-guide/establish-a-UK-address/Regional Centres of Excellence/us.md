Base your business anywhere in the UK and you will benefit from an ambitious and coordinated strategy for regional growth and improved productivity. London is the largest capital city in Europe, but businesses thrive in areas all around the country. 

A number of Government-backed initiatives could help you find the perfect location for your business: 

**Clusters:** Clusters of businesses from the same or complimentary industry sectors have come together as centres of excellence and innovation across the UK. Locating your business in a relevant cluster could help you **access a larger pool of skilled labour, improve your supply chains and share knowledge, ideas and research and development costs.** 

**Enterprise Zones:** Enterprise Zones offer a wide range of support to help businesses establish and expand in the UK. There are now over 50 existing or planned zones in England and Wales, with a further 16 Enterprise Areas in Scotland. Businesses in these locations can benefit from **simplified planning application processes,various financial advantages and a business-ready infrastructure.** 

Find out more about locating potential Clusters and Enterprise Zones that may work for you by contacting your [local DIT advisor](https://www.contactus.ukti.gov.uk/enquiry/topic)
