title: "Government support for UK oil and gas"
---
In 2015, the UK government introduced a 1.3 billion GBP package of tax measures for the oil and gas industry to ensure that the UK Continental Shelf remains an attractive destination for investment.

The government also committed 20 million GBP in funding for the second round of seismic surveys to support new exploration activity on the UK Continental Shelf. This will give companies a greater chance of discovering opportunities without having to fund the surveys themselves.

The government also has up to 50 billion GBP available to support finance and insurance for supplies from within the UK to buyers outside the UK. This support takes the form of guarantees, insurance and loans issued by its export credit agency, [UK Export Finance](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/uk-export-finance).
