The UK government is committed to delivering new and replacement energy supplies that can provide secure, reliable, low-carbon electricity. Nuclear energy is central to these plans.

Nuclear energy has operated reliably and safely in the UK for over 60 years. We have extensive experience of the full nuclear life cycle, from front-end design through to decommissioning. Today, 8 nuclear power plants generate around 20% of the UKâ€™s electricity demand.
