With the positive transformation taking place in our nuclear industry, the prospects for businesses to establish themselves in the UK supply chain are vast. 

We have major infrastructure projects that include: 

- new build opportunities
- decommissioning
- waste management programmes

The industry has set out proposals to develop 18 gigawatts (GW) of nuclear generating capacity at 6 sites in the UK. These projects could lead to a significant reduction in CO2 emissions and the creation of around 35,000 jobs at the peak of construction. 

We have new build sites in:

- Hinkley Point C, Somerset
- Sizewell, Suffolk
- Moorside, Cumbria
- Wylfa, Anglesey
- Oldbury, Gloucestershire
- Bradwell, Essex

Decommissioning is another source of opportunity. The [Nuclear Decommissioning Authority](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/nuclear-decommissioning-authority) (NDA) is responsible for the decommissioning and cleaning up of our civil public sector nuclear legacy. The agency  currently manage 17 sites through this process. The goal is to achieve the end state for all sites by 2125.

The UK government will spend 3.2 billion GBP on decommissioning in 2016/17. The government have also  invested £90 million every year on research and development to ensure that the complex technical challenges can be conquered effectively. 

### Government plans for Small Modular Reactor development

The government have backed plans to develop the next generation of [Small Modular Reactors](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/small-modular-reactors) (SMR), a technology which could play an important role in the world’s clean energy future. 

Government have made a further commitment to invest at least £250 million in nuclear research and development. This includes a [competition to find the best value SMR designs.](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/small-modular-reactors-competition-phase-one)

According to the National Nuclear Laboratory, the global SMR market iit's estimated that the global SMR market will be approximately 65-85GW by 2035 and valued at 250 to 400 billion GBP. If the economics of this approach prove competitive, there could be significant advantages for businesses involved in the UK’s development programme.

### A world class regulatory system

At the heart of our nuclear programme is a world-class independent regulatory system. The[ Office for Nuclear Regulation](http://www.onr.org.uk/) and the [Environment Agency ](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/environment-agency)work together to make sure that any new nuclear power stations built here meet high standards of safety, security, environmental protection and waste management. This process is called the [Generic Design Assessment](http://www.onr.org.uk/new-reactors/) (GDA).

Businesses that achieve GDA approval in the UK are recognised as meeting the most rigorous standards in the nuclear industry, providing them with a stepping-stone for further international growth.
