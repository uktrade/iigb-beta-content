With the positive transformation taking place in our nuclear industry, the prospects for businesses to establish themselves in the UK supply chain are vast. 

We have major infrastructure projects that include: 

- new build opportunities
- decommissioning
- waste management programmes

This means that businesses can build long-term, high impact relationships that generate a strong return on investment.

Potentially, there are huge benefits for overseas investors working in partnership with UK companies.  Strong relationships built in the UK are likely to translate into global opportunities. 

### Supply chain opportunities 
The industry has set out proposals to develop 18GW of nuclear generating capacity at 6 sites in the UK. These projects could lead to a significant reduction in CO2 emissions and the creation of around 35,000 jobs at the peak of construction. 

We have new build sites in Hinkley Point C, Somerset, Sizewell, Suffolk, Moorside, Cumbria, Wlfa, Anglesey, Oldbury, Gloucestershire and Bradwell

Decommissioning is another source of opportunity.  [The Nuclear Decommissioning Authority](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/nuclear-decommissioning-authority) (NDA) is responsible for the decommissioning and clean up of our civil public sector nuclear legacy. We currently manage 17 sites through this process. Our goal is to achieve the end state for all sites by 2125.

We’ll spend £3.2 billion in 2016/17. We have also invested £90 million every year on research and development to ensure that the complex technical challenges can be conquered effectively. 

Additionally, we have backed plans to develop the next generation of Small Modular Reactors (SMR), a technology which could play an important role in the world’s clean energy future. 

The UK government has made a commitment to invest at least £250 million in nuclear research and development. This includes a competition to find the best value SMR designs. 

According to the National Nuclear Laboratory, the global SMR market is calculated to be approximately 65-85GW by 2035 and valued at £250-£400bn. If the economics prove competitive, there could be significant advantages for businesses involved in the UK’s development programme.

**A world class regulatory system**

At the heart of our nuclear programme is a world-class independent regulatory system. The [Office for Nuclear Regulation](http://www.onr.org.uk/) and [Environment Agency](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/environment-agency) work together to make sure that any new nuclear power stations built here meet high standards of safety, security, environmental protection and waste management. This process is called the Generic Design Assessment (GDA).

Businesses that achieve GDA approval in the UK are recognised as meeting the most rigorous standards in the nuclear industry, providing them with a stepping-stone for further international growth.
