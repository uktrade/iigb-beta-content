More than 65,000 people currently work in the UK’s civil nuclear industry. These are skilled workers with experience in fuel manufacturing, the operation and maintenance of reactors, and management of the waste generated from the operations.

Nuclear expertise is well-distributed across the nation, but there are specific areas where many major businesses share research and development. These include: 

- north west England, where [Sellafield](http://www.sellafieldsites.com/) remains the major centre for the maintenance of nuclear skills
- south west England, where EDF Energy has established a base and Horizon Nuclear Power has begun deployment
- Yorkshire and the Humber - where there is growth around Sheffield, home of the [Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre](http://www.amrc.co.uk/)

### The UK government and nuclear industry partners skills development initiatives

There are government and privately backed initiatives in place to help develop skills and knowledge in the UK’s nuclear sector. The [National College for Nuclear](https://www.nsan.co.uk/news/national-nuclear-college) works closely with the industry on a world-class curriculum that delivers high-level technical training and development. 

Degree apprenticeships focused on nuclear engineering are providing both higher education and work-based skills and experience for the future nuclear workforce.
