In the UK, your company will benefit from a highly skilled workforce with extensive research and development experience, focused on benefitting the customer.
 
We have universities offering world-class engineering degrees at undergraduate and postgraduate level, all feeding into our energy industries.

With the involvement of network operators and the supply chain, the industryâ€™s apprenticeship system provides training at all levels, ensuring the success of the next generation of UK produced technologies.
