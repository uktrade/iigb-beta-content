Innovate UK, the UK's innovation agency, provides funding support for innovations, which are integrating, low-carbon technologies into the energy system.
 
The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy also has an innovation fund for products and services for decarbonising the electricity network. 

The UK government also has up to 50 billion GBP available to support finance and insurance for supplies from within the UK to buyers outside the UK. This support takes the form of guarantees, insurance and loans issued by the UK government export credit agency, [UK Export Finance](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/uk-export-finance).
