We have long been recognised as a pioneering nation in the field of energy from waste. World leaders such as SITA, Veolia and FCC all have operations here. 

The UK market is maturing, and thereâ€™s further demand for waste management infrastructure. In 2013, the renewable energy market created 6.8 billion GBP in gross value. Estimates suggest that by 2020 there will still be between 5 and 15 million tonnes of waste in the UK that needs treatment. This  will require 3 to 9 billion GBP of investment.
