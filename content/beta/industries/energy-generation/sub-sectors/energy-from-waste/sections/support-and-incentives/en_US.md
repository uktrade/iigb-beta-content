title: "Government help for renewable energy businesses in the UK"
---
The UK has funding options to assist companies that want to develop sustainable energy facilities. These sources of funding change regularly to meet market demand and are dependent on the type of project and your location within the UK.

The UK’s [UK’s Renewable Heat Incentive](https://www.ofgem.gov.uk/environmental-programmes/domestic-rhi) helps businesses meet the cost of installing renewable heat technologies.

The government also has up to 50 billion GBP available to support finance and insurance for   supplies from within the UK to buyers outside the UK. This support takes the form of guarantees, insurance and loans issued by its export credit agency, [UK Export Finance](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/uk-export-finance).
