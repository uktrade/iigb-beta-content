With clusters of wind farms across the UK, we offer a competitive and innovative climate for offshore wind investment. The offshore wind sector currently employs around 15,000 people, with this number growing year-on-year as the industry develops. 

Our rich history of working offshore means we have thousands of skilled workers. Their experience of working in other parts of the offshore energy sector ensures a smooth transition into offshore wind.

The biggest areas of UK offshore employment and expertise are:

- site planning and development
- construction and installation
- manufacturing and manufacturing design
- operations and maintenance
- specialised transport and other support services

Top universities like Manchester, Sheffield and Strathclyde all offer subjects which support students entering the offshore wind industry. 
 
Companies in the UK benefit from specialist training providers, such as Maersk Training, Advanced Industrial Solutions and Siemens, that offer highly specialised training for the offshore wind industry.
