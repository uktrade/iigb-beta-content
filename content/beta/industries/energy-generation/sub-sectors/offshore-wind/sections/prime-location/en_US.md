The UK places highly in international rankings for the best place to invest in offshore wind and has managed to attract investment from across the globe for related infrastructure and manufacturing.

Suppliers like Siemens and MHI Vestas Offshore have already chosen the UK as their site for future world class manufacturing facilities, and there are significant opportunities for further investment in the supply chain.

We already have 5.7 gigawatts (GW) of offshore wind installed or under construction. We’re on track to deliver 10GW by 2020 - this represents the largest expansion in any class of renewable energy technology in the UK.

We’re also home to the largest operational offshore wind farm in the world, London Array (630 megawatts). By 2020, we’ll have the world’s first wind farm generating over 1GW of energy, at Dong Energy’s Hornsea Project One located off the coast of Yorkshire. This wind farm will be capable of powering over a million homes.
 
Our industry and government are working together to build a competitive and innovative supply chain that creates and sustains jobs, exports and economic benefits for the UK.
 
UK companies lead the world in services for the design, development, financing, construction and operation of offshore wind plants. There are also investment opportunities in the supply chain for the manufacturing of wind turbine components.
