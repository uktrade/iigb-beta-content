title: "Government help for offshore wind development in the UK"
---

The UK government has committed to invest in offshore wind energy for decades. The current installed offshore wind capacity of 5.7GW is due to increase to 10 GW by 2020, and then to increase by an estimated 10GW by 2030. 

The UK enjoys a longstanding reputation for operating stable and predictable regimes to support investment in renewable electricity infrastructure. Contracts for difference (CfD) provide stable long-term revenues for offshore wind projects, giving certainty on returns for investors.
 
Alongside a supportive policy regime, the UK government supports its offshore wind industry by:

- providing market confidence and demand visibility (critical for investment by developers and the supply chain)
- building a competitive supply chain that attracts inward investment
- offering support to UK-based companies to develop the capability and capacity to bid for, and win, contracts in the UK and overseas
- supporting innovation that is vital to achieving cost reduction
- enabling new players to enter the market with new product designs
- providing support to access funding for developers and the supply chain
- building a highly skilled workforce

The UK government also has up to 50 billion GBP available to support finance and insurance for supplies from within the UK to buyers outside the UK. This support takes the form of guarantees, insurance and loans issued by the UK government export credit agency, [UK Export Finance](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/uk-export-finance).
