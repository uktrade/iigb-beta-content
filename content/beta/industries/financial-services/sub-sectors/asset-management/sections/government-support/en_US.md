title: "Government support for asset management businesses in the UK"
---
The UK has one of the most competitive tax regimes in the world for both funds and asset managers. Funds that are domiciled in the UK can take advantage of around 120 double taxation agreements, more than in any other country.


The UK government has the ambition for us to lead the world in investment management and has demonstrated a strong commitment to the sector. In 2013, it implemented the [Investment Management Strategy](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-investment-management-strategy-launched-by-ministers), which is focused on improving the UK's taxation regime, improving the regulatory environment, reducing fund authorisation times, and representing the UK globally through effective marketing.

The government also has up to 50 billion GBP available to support finance and insurance for   supplies from within the UK to buyers outside the UK. This support takes the form of guarantees, insurance and loans issued by its export credit agency, [UK Export Finance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/inward-investment-access-to-the-uks-export-credit-agency).
