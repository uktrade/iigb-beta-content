**Strong regulatory and tax support**

The financial services industry is supported in the UK by its regulator the [Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)](https://www.fca.org.uk/about/the-fca). The regulators operate independently of the UK government to regulate financial firms providing services to consumers and maintain the integrity of the UK’s financial markets.

[The FCA supports disruptive technologies](https://www.fca.org.uk/news/speeches/uk-fintech-regulating-innovation) and helps companies develop new business models through their [Project Innovate and Innovation Hub](https://www.fca.org.uk/firms/project-innovate-innovation-hub)

The UK government offers a range of tax incentives and programmes to promote competition and innovation.

They include:

- the Enterprise Investment Scheme
- the Seed Enterprise Investment Scheme 
- Entrepreneurs’ Relief 
- Research and development tax credits
- the Patent Box scheme, where companies pay a lower rate of Corporation Tax on profits earned from their patented innovations
