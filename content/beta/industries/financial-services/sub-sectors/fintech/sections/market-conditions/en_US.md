The UK FinTech sector had a turnover of about £6.6 billion in revenue in 2015 and attracted about £524 million in investment in 2015.

The 4 strongest performing areas are:

- payments, which currently attract a wide range of innovators
- platforms, particularly peer-to-peer lending, trading, personal wealth management and aggregators
- software for risk management, payments, asset management, capital markets, insurance and accounting
- data analytics such as credit reference, capital markets and insurance

There is ample room in the market for established providers and disruptive technologies. Many different sources of finance are available and the sector is well served by angel and private equity investors, accelerator and incubator schemes.

###Status and enthusiasm drives demand

Demand for FinTech in the UK is strong, driven by [London’s status as the global capital of finance](http://www.longfinance.net/global-financial-centres-index-20/1037-gfci-20.html). This concentration of financial services activity means great opportunity for FinTech solutions providers, particularly in the areas of:

- trading
- regulation
- data
- compliance

Our consumers are early adopters, and are open to new, innovative models of service delivery. They spend much more on e-commerce than their equivalents in Germany, France and the USA. Consumer adoption of FinTech is becoming mainstream. The [EY FinTech Adoption Index](http://www.ey.com/gl/en/industries/financial-services/ey-fintech-adoption-index) states that around 14% of digitally active consumers identify themselves as FinTech users, rising to 25% in London.

Many small and medium enterprises (SMEs) have also adopted FinTech solutions, in the alternative finance and payments subsectors.
