title: "The demand for UK components"
---
The UK’s automotive supply chain is currently enjoying a period of unprecedented growth. In 2015, our automotive manufacturers spent 31 billion GBP on components and that sum is growing by 3 billion GBP per year.

The local content of UK-made cars rose from 36% in 2011 to 44% in 2017, and is continuing to increase. UK car manufacturers have identified an additional 4 billion GBP of annual component purchasing they would like to buy from UK suppliers, but are not always able to do so as UK component plants are already running close to or at full capacity. This provides a huge opportunity for overseas investors setting up in the UK.
