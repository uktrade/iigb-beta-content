All these areas have dedicated bodies which assist and promote their local automotive industry.

In the Midlands, [Drive West Midland](http://www.drivewestmidlands.co.uk/) is a pioneering programme that supports the development of small or medium sized enterprises and coordinates local support services for the automotive sector. 

Further north, there is the [Northern Automotive Alliance](http://northernautoalliance.com/) and the [North East Automotive Alliance](https://www.northeastautomotivealliance.com/) Both organisations provide support to companies setting up in the region, as well as to the industry at large. 

The government also has up to 50 billion GBP available to support finance and insurance for supplies from within the UK to buyers outside the UK. This support takes the form of guarantees, insurance and loans issued by its export credit agency, [UK Export Finance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/inward-investment-access-to-the-uks-export-credit-agency).
