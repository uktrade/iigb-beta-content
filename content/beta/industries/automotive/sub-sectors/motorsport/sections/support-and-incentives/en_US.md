The UK gGovernment is committed to the continued success of the UK car industry. It’s contributing over £1.2 billion to automotive research funds, covering low carbon propulsion, lightweight materials plusand connected and autonomous vehicles.
We’re also creating the right environment for new technology to thrive. Our regulatory framework for connected and autonomous vehicles is the most progressive in Europe. (hyperlink to R&D page). This enables car manufacturers and major component suppliers to develop and test their technology in the UK with the minimum of bureaucracy. Volvo has already committed to the UK as the only ‘“neutral’” testing venue outside its own factory locations. 

**A supportive business environment, focused on the future**

The UK benefits from a supportive business environment, offering the most competitive and flexible labour market in western Europe. Workers in the UK car industry add more value per car than anywhere else in Europe. 


The UK government is implementing a long-term strategy focused on further developing the skills of its workforce. Working with the Automotive Council, it’s also looking to improve the competitiveness of the UK supply chain and support emerging technologies. This will create even more opportunities for companies investing in the UK.
