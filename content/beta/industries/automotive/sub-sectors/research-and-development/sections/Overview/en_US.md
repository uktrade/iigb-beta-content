title: "Government-backed innovation"

In 2009, the UK government and the UK automotive industry set up a partnership called the [Automotive Council](http://www.automotivecouncil.co.uk/), to chart the renaissance of the UK auto sector. This is now seen internationally as the gold standard for government and industry cooperation, and has led to a huge expansion of both car manufacturing and automotive research and development (R&D) in the UK.

### Facilitating innovation

The capability of UK automotive R&D is demonstrated by the fact that 6 of the 10 Formula One teams have their headquarters in the UK. Formula One depends on the ability of British teams and their 4,500 UK motorsport suppliers to develop world-beating solutions.

While the ability of our engineers to develop revolutionary solutions has never been in doubt, the major change over recent years is the establishment of a comprehensive infrastructure to take concepts from laboratory to production.

[Innovate UK,](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/innovate-uk) the UK innovation agency, supports the development of concepts to prototypes (Technology Readiness Level, or TRL 3 to 5). While the network of manufacturing Catapults helps transforms prototypes to production-ready products (TRL 5 to 8).

### The low-emission vehicles market and UK government support

The UK is the largest ultra low emission vehicle (ULEV) market in the EU with over 110,000 ULEVs on the road. 

Grants for consumers to purchase ULEVs and improved charging infrastructure have caused this market growth. The UK government and automotive industry are funding a 1 billion GBP Advanced Propulsion Centre for later stage R&D projects around low carbon powertrain and production.

The UK government has supported the early market for ULEVs with investment of 1 billion GBP.

The UK already has the largest network of rapid charging points for electric vehicles in Europe, as part of a network of over 10,000 publicly accessible chargepoints. And in 2016, 1 in 5 electric cars sold in Europe was made in the UK.

The UK government is supporting the automotive industry to bring improve the effectiveness of electric vehicles, reduce their cost and to increase their range. It will invest 246 million GBP over 4 years in the design, development and manufacture of batteries for vehicle electrification.
