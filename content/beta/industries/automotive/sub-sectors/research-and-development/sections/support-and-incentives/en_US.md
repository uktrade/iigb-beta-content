title: "UK government support for automotive R&D"
---

The UK government is absolutely committed to the continued success of the UK car industry by providing over 1.2 billion GBP to automotive research funds. These cover low-carbon propulsion, lightweight materials and connected and autonomous vehicles.

We’re also creating the right environment for new technology to thrive. Our regulatory framework for connected and autonomous vehicles is the most progressive in Europe. This enables car manufacturers and major component suppliers to develop and test their technology with the minimum of bureaucracy. Already, Volvo has committed to the UK as the only ‘neutral’ testing venue outside its own factory locations. 

### A supportive business environment, focused on the future

The UK benefits from a supportive business environment, offering the most competitive and flexible labour market in western Europe. Workers in the UK car industry add more value per car than anywhere else in Europe. 

The government also has up to 50 billion GBP available to support finance and insurance for   supplies from within the UK to buyers outside the UK. This support takes the form of guarantees, insurance and loans issued by its export credit agency, [UK Export Finance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/inward-investment-access-to-the-uks-export-credit-agency).
