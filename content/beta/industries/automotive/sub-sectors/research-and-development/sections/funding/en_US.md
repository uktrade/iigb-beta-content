### Low carbon propulsion

The UK is already a global powertrain centre, manufacturing over 2.5 million petrol and diesel engines a year. We’re now leading the move into electrified powertrains, with battery electric vehicles or hydrogen fuel cells. The UK government and the UK car industry has agreed to jointly invest an unprecedented 1 billion GBP over 10 years developing low carbon propulsion systems. This is administered via the [Advanced Propulsion Centre (APC).](http://www.apcuk.co.uk/) APC runs 2 competitions per year for companies seeking up to 50% funding for projects that will lead to a reduction in the carbon emissions of road vehicles.

### Lightweighting

The UK has an unmatched track record in the development of lightweight materials, from the first carbon fibre used in Formula One by McLaren in 1981 to the current model range of Jaguar Land Rover, the world’s most aluminium-intensive car manufacturer.

One of the most significant materials for the future of road cars is carbon fibre composites.  This presents an opportunity to take the UK’s leading position in motorsport and aerospace and apply it to the emerging market for mass-produced carbon fibre for car production. This is being assisted by the [High Value Manufacturing Catapult,](https://hvm.catapult.org.uk/) a world-leading network of facilities where composites companies can take advantage of the latest test and development machinery. 

### Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs)

The UK is a leader in the field of CAVs. The UK government has created a 200 million GBP fund administered by the Centre for Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CCAV), which is jointly funded by the industry and the government. It offers grants through a competitive bidding process.

The UK offers substantial advantages in CAV technology. According to Eurostat, 40% of all large European software companies are based in the UK. With a history of early adoption of technology from home PCs to Internet shopping, the UK has all the right building blocks to develop CAVs. 

We’re also establishing ourselves as a leading destination for CAV development, with the world’s most progressive regulatory regime. Testing is possible on any of our roads.
