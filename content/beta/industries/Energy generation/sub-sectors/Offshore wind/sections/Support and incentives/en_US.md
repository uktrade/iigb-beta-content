The UK government has made a commitment to invest in offshore wind energy for generations to come. The current installed offshore wind capacity of 5.7 GW is due to increase to 10 GW by 2020, and then to increase by an estimated 10 GW by 2030.  

The UK enjoys a longstanding reputation for operating stable and predictable regimes to support investment in renewable electricity infrastructure. Contracts for Difference (CfD) provide stable long-term revenues for offshore wind projects, giving certainty on returns for investors.
 
A Levy Control Framework (LCF) provides long-term visibility of liabilities under these regimes, assisting investment planning and providing transparency and stability in public policy.
 
Alongside a supportive policy regime the UK government supports the UK offshore wind industry by:

- providing market confidence and demand visibility, which is critical for investment by developers and the supply chain
- building a competitive supply chain that attracts inward investment
- offering support to UK based companies to develop the capability and capacity to bid for, and win, contracts in the UK and overseas.
- supporting innovation, that’s vital to achieving cost reduction
- enabling new players to enter the market with new product designs
- providing support to access funding for developers and the supply chain
- building a highly a skilled workforce
