### World-leading expertise

More than 80,000 people have jobs that are directly or indirectly linked to our civil nuclear industry.  These are skilled workers with the experience in fuel manufacturing, operation and maintenance of reactors, and management of the waste generated from the operations.  

Nuclear expertise is well distributed across the nation, but there are specific cluster areas where many major businesses  share research, development and thinking. These include: 
- North West England, where [Sellafield](http://www.sellafieldsites.com/) remains the major centre for maintenance of nuclear skills
- South West England where EDF has established a base and Horizon has begun deployment
- Yorkshire and Humber where growth is occurring around Sheffield, which is home to the [Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre](http://www.amrc.co.uk/)
