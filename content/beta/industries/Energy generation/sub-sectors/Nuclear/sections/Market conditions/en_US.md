With the positive transformation taking place in our nuclear industry, the prospects for businesses to establish themselves in the UK supply chain are vast. 

We have major infrastructure projects across 17 sites, that include: 
- new build opportunities
- decommissioning
- waste management programmes

This means that businesses can build long-term, high impact relationships that generate a strong return on investment.

Potentially, there are huge benefits for overseas investors working in partnership with UK companies.  Strong relationships built in the UK are likely to translate into global opportunities.

### Supply chain opportunities

Nuclear new build will be a major source of new opportunities for investors. We plan to build 12 new nuclear reactors in 5 sites by 2030.  This will provide 16GWe of new nuclear capacity. These projects could lead to an estimated 40 million tonnes of CO2 emissions savings and the creation of around 35,000 jobs at the peak of construction. 

There are currently 3 major consortiums investing in our nuclear new builds: 
- EDF Energy/CGN
- Horizon Nuclear Power
- NuGeneration Limited

We have new build sites in Hinkley Point, Somerset (EDF Energy), Sizewell, Suffolk (EDF Energy), Moorside, Sellafield (NuGeneration), Wylfa, Anglesey (Horizon), Oldbury, Gloucestershire (Horizon), and Bradwell, Essex (EDF Energy/CGN)

Decommissioning is another source of opportunity.  The Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) is responsible for the decommissioning and clean up of our civil public sector nuclear legacy. We currently manage 17 sites through this process. Our goal is to achieve the end state for all sites by 2125.

We’ll spend £3.2 billion in 2016/17. We have also invested £90 million every year on research and development to ensure that the complex technical challenges can be conquered effectively. 

Additionally, we have backed plans to develop the next generation of Small Modular Reactors (SMR), a technology which could play an important role in the world’s clean energy future. 

UK government has made a commitment to invest at least £250 million in nuclear research and development. This includes a competition to find the best value SMR designs. 

According to the National Nuclear Laboratory, the global SMR market is calculated to be approximately 65-85GW by 2035 and valued at £250-£400bn. If the economics prove competitive, there could be significant advantages for businesses involved in the UK’s development programme.

### A world class regulatory system

At the heart of our nuclear programme is a world-class independent regulatory system. The Office for Nuclear Regulation and Environment Agency work together to make sure that any new nuclear power stations built here meet high standards of safety, security, environmental protection and waste management. This process is called the Generic Design Assessment (GDA).

Businesses that achieve GDA approval in the UK are recognised as meeting the most rigorous standards in the nuclear industry, providing them with a stepping-stone for further international growth.
