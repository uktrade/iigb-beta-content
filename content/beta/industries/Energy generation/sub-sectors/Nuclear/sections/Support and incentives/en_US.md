### An emphasis on research and development

There are government and privately backed initiatives in place to help develop further skills and knowledge in the UK’s nuclear sector. The National College for Nuclear, works closely with the industry on a world-class curriculum that delivers high-level technical training and development. 

Degree Apprenticeships, focused on nuclear engineering, provide the next generation with higher education and work based skills and experience. 

Additionally, companies operating here benefit from the Nuclear Advanced Manufacturing Centre’s [Fit for Nuclear](http://namrc.co.uk/services/f4n/) . This is a unique assessment service which supports manufacturing companies to measure their operations against the standards required to supply the nuclear industry.
