title: "The UK's growing freefrom market"
---

Around one-third of British consumers are buying and eating free-from food, of whom:
* 22% buy gluten-free products
* 19% buy dairy-free products
* 16% buy wheat-free and lactose-free products

Gluten-free baked goods make up the majority of the free-from category - the market for these products grew nearly 30% between 2013 and 2015, to 210 million GBP. In 2015, 12% of new food products launched in the UK claimed to be gluten-free.

Frozen free-from food products are now worth approximately 15 million GBP with frozen prepared ready meals contributing to just over 9 million GBP of the market value.
