The UK freeform market is seen as a priority destination for international food and drink companies. 

Freefrom products have one or more ingredients such as gluten and dairy removed as a growing number of consumers are either allergic, intolerant or believe them to be a healthier choice.

The market offers long term growth opportunities due to: 
- increased awareness of the freefrom category
- the popularity and demand for a freefrom lifestyle
- increasing new product development and innovations
- continued growth of the sector
