## UK food and drink industry specialisms
### Food and drink packaging
The UK packaging industry is a large and developed sector with annual sales of 10.9 billion GBP. Of this, 7.1 billion GBP is used for food and drink. The majority of UK production is sold in the UK and a majority of UK sales are made in the UK.

There are 85,000 jobs in the packaging sector, representing 3% of UK manufacturing employment. 

Packaging in the UK helps support the demand to reduce waste. The UK wastes just 3% of food, which is very low by international and historic standards. And over 67% of packaging in the UK is recycled, which is ahead of EU targets.

### Food-service and catering sector in the UK
The UK’s catering industry is worth an estimated 88 billion GBP - around 43% of total consumer spending on food and drink.

There were 453,000 registered restaurant and catering establishments in the UK in 2014 and the UK eating-out market was worth 33.5 billion GBP in 2014, according to Mintel.

Food sales are the fastest growing category in the pub market. Meals sold in pubs grew in value by 14% from 2012 to 2016 and sales of alcoholic drinks grew by 6% over the same period.

Mintel estimated the UK contract catering sector to be worth 3.8 billion GBP in 2014 and is forecast to grow to be almost 4.2 billion GBP by 2020.

### The UK’s pork, poultry and dairy supply chain
#### Poultry

There are opportunities in the poultry supply chain as the UK is currently a net importer of both chicken and eggs. 

Annual UK consumer spending on chicken is around 2.5 billion GBP.

The largest sector of imports, by both volume and value remains fresh or frozen whole chickens with a 50% value share and 53% by volume.

The UK egg market was valued at 965 million GBP in 2016-7 and has grown for the preceding 7 years. More than half of eggs sold were 'free range'. 

#### Dairy products

The UK is the third largest dairy producing country in the EU and the tenth largest producer in the world.

Dairy farming accounts for 17% of UK agricultural production and is the largest agricultural sector in the UK.

There are over 1.9 million cows in the UK, representing 8% of the EU dairy herd in 2016.

Export volumes are highest for milk and cream, accounting for around 73% of the exported dairy volume for within the EU and 66% outside of the EU.

Müller, a German dairy company, opened a 17 million GBP butter-making factory in Market Drayton in 2013. The dairy facility is the biggest of its kind in the UK, processing around 90,000 tonnes of cream about 45,000 tonnes of butter a year.

#### Pork and pork products

The UK has a low self-sufficiency index for pork and pork products, indicating both consumer demand and opportunity for companies to set up to meet this demand within the UK.
