The UK government is fully committed to supporting the UK as a creative nation.

Your innovative content will be protected and supported here. We support creative businesses in the UK by employing a strong intellectual property regime and regulatory framework.  We also have a number of internationally renowned trade associations offering professional guidance, training and development.

Our creative tax relief offers help in starting or growing your business here, and has made production more attractive than ever. This allows businesses to access a rebate of up to 25% of qualifying spend for:
- film
- animation
- high-end and childrenâ€™s TV
- video games development
- theatre 

We also offer a number of world-class digital startup programmes and opportunities for angel investment in creative content enterprises.

All of these measures complement our low level of corporation tax, which is set to drop to 17% by 2020.

The government also has up to 50 billion GBP available to support finance and insurance for   supplies from within the UK to buyers outside the UK. This support takes the form of guarantees, insurance and loans issued by its export credit agency, [UK Export Finance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/inward-investment-access-to-the-uks-export-credit-agency).
