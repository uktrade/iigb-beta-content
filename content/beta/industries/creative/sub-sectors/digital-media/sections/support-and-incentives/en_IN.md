+The UK government is fully committed to supporting the UK as a leading digital nation. 
+
+Our help for early stage innovation and research and development (R&D) is second to none. You can take advantage of a number of tax incentives to develop and innovate here including:
+ 
+- Seed Enterprise Investment Scheme – a model for tax efficient investment at the seed and angel phase which is attracting new investors into the technology and start up environment
+- R&D tax credits – small and medium sized companies can write R&D investment off against tax to a rate of 230%
+- The Patent Box enables companies to apply a lower rate of Corporation Tax to profits earned from its patented inventions
+
+The government has invested more than 200 million GBP in a network of Technology and Innovation Centres supporting the commercialisation of new technologies by business. Innovate UK, the UK’s innovation support agency, invests in R&D related to strategic sector development targets.
+
+We also offer a number of world-class digital start-up programmes and opportunities for angel investment. 
+
+All of these measures complement our low level of corporation tax, which is set to drop to 17% by 2020.
+
+The government also has up to 50 billion GBP available to support finance and insurance for supplies from within the UK to buyers outside the UK. This support takes the form of guarantees, insurance and loans issued by its export credit agency, [UK Export Finance](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/uk-export-finance).
