- a strong start-up culture bolstered by tech clusters all over the UK
- a ranking of third best place in the world in the  [Global Innovation Index in 2016](https://www.globalinnovationindex.org/analysis-indicator)
- an active venture capital community - the UK has the highest number of initial public offerings (IPOs) & more tech “unicorns” (a start-up company valued at over 1 billion USD) created than anywhere else in Europe
- the largest e-commerce market in Europe
- 4 of the world’s top 10 universities, plus educational providers that develop our technology workforce
 
The UK's technology economy has strengths in electronic systems, communications, data management and analytics, data centres, cloud services, Artificial Intelligence, cyber, semiconductor design and sensors.
