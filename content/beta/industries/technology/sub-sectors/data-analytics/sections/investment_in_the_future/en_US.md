title: "Support for data analytics businesses in the UK"
---

The UK currently has more than 30 programmes that provide investment support to accelerate new data analytics companies. The UK’s Open Data Institute has supported more than 28 start-up companies working in open data and analytics.

The sector is seen as vital to the economic health of the nation and this is backed up by substantial investment in the industry. All 7 UK Research Councils have invested in big data analytics projects providing total investment of more than 300 million GBP.  

An established and thriving market, solid infrastructure and a skilled workforce point to a bright future for the UK’s data analytics sector.

The government also has up to 50 billion GBP available to support finance and insurance for   supplies from within the UK to buyers outside the UK. This support takes the form of guarantees, insurance and loans issued by its export credit agency, [UK Export Finance](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/uk-export-finance).
