title: The UK’s investment in the future
---

The UK currently has more than 30 programmes that provide investment support to accelerate new data analytics companies. The UK’s Open Data Institute has supported more than 28 start-up companies working in open data and analytics.

The sector is seen as vital to the economic health of the nation and this is backed up by substantial investment in the industry. All 7 UK Research Councils have invested in big data analytics projects providing total investment of more than £300 million.  

An established and thriving market, solid infrastructure and a skilled workforce point to a bright future for the UK’s data analytics sector.
