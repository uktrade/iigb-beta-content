The UK is the global home of motorsport. Seven of the 11 Formula One motor racing teams, including McLaren, Williams and Mercedes-Benz, have made the UK their HQ. 

We have world-class universities, with 4 of the world’s Top 10 universities, and 9 of the Top 10 EU universities according to the international QS ranking.

We have leading engineering companies like Ricardo and world-class automotive research facilities thanks to the recently-established [Catapult network]().

We’re leading the move to low carbon propulsion. Europe’s only large scale battery facility for electric cars is here. Currently we account for over 20% of European electric vehicle production.
