title: "The Growing Hub of  Automotive R&D"
---
In 2009, the UK government and the UK automotive industry set up a partnership called the Automotive Council, to chart the renaissance of the UK auto sector. This is now seen internationally as the gold-standard for government and industry cooperation, and has led to a huge expansion of both car manufacturing and automotive research and development (R&D) in the UK.

**Facilitating innovation**

The capability of UK automotive R&amp;D is demonstrated by the fact that 7 of the 11 Formula One teams have their HQ in the UK. Formula One depends on the ability of British teams and their 4,500 UK motorsport suppliers to develop world-beating solutions.

While the ability of our engineers to develop revolutionary solutions has never been in doubt, the major change over recent years is the establishment of a comprehensive infrastructure to take concepts from laboratory to production.

Innovate UK, the UK innovation agency, supports development of concepts to prototypes (Technology Readiness Level, or TRL, 3 to 5), while the network of manufacturing Catapults helps transforms prototypes to production-ready products (TRL 5-8).
