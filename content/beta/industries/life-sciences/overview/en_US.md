The UK is an attractive place for health and life sciences companies to invest. Currently, there are over 5,600 companies operating in the UK, generating an approximate £60.7 billion. 

We are home to 4 of the world’s top 10 universities and are the principal recipient of public and private life sciences financing.

We have a rich heritage powered by innovative research and a tax structure that rewards innovation. 

Our strong science base and track record of life sciences excellence are currently attracting the attentions of big pharmaceutical companies.

The UK is a natural test bed for health and life sciences products as we have:

- a population of more than 60 million people served by our National Health Service (NHS)
- a health research infrastructure funded by government
- the significant international influence of the Medicines & Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) on clinical trials and product regulations
- the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) on health technology assessment
