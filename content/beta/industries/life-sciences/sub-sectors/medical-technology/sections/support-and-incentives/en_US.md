The UK offers access to innovative researchers in engineering, physical, social, medical, and digital sciences. 

If you’re investing in or setting up in the UK, you can benefit from supportive medical technology partners at every step of your journey from design to development to delivery.

### Organisations that provide support

The [EPSRC Centre for innovative manufacturing in medical devices](https://www.epsrc.ac.uk/research/centres/innovativemanufacturing/imrcmedicaldevices) is developing advanced methods for functionally stratified design and near-patient manufacturing. This enables cost effective matching of device function to the patient needs and surgical environment.

[Innovate UK](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/innovate-uk) stimulates technology-enabled innovation. Its Knowledge Transfer Partnership can help businesses develop collaborative partnerships with the UK’s world-class universities, colleges and research organisations.

The [High-Value Manufacturing Catapult](https://hvm.catapult.org.uk/) can support rapid prototyping and help businesses work with leading scientists and engineers to transform manufacturing ideas into valuable products and services.

The [National Institute for Health Research](http://www.nihr.ac.uk/life-sciences-industry/) (NIHR) Office for Clinical Research Infrastructure and Clinical Research Network offers access to academic and clinical expertise and collaboration. It also provides  a managed service for clinical studies, funding opportunities, data samples and analytical support for research.

The NIHR’s [Invention for Innovation](http://www.nihr.ac.uk/funding-and-support/funding-for-research-studies/how-to-apply/research-programmes/invention-for-innovation/) (i4i) Programme is a funding scheme to advance healthcare technologies and interventions for increased patient benefit in areas of existing or emerging clinical need. i4i supports collaborative research and development projects that have demonstrated proof-of-principle and have a clear pathway towards adoption and commercialisation.

The [Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/medicines-and-healthcare-products-regulatory-agency) (MHRA) is a pragmatic and supportive regulator with significant expertise in medical technologies and drug-device combinations.The MHRA's Innovation Office helps organisations that are developing innovative medicines, medical devices or using new manufacturing processes.

The[ National Institute for Health and Care Excellence](https://www.nice.org.uk/) (NICE) is a world leader in health technology assessment. It produces independent, authoritative and evidence-based guidance on the most efficient ways to prevent, diagnose and treat disease and ill health. Its Office for Market Access will help you understand NICE processes, how to work with the body to achieve your aimsand how NICE links with different parts of the system.

The NICE [Medical Technologies Evaluation Programme](https://www.nice.org.uk/About/What-we-do/Our-Programmes/NICE-guidance/NICE-medical-technologies-evaluation-programme) identifies medical technologies that have the potential to offer substantial benefit to patients. Medical technologies are likely to be adopted consistently and rapidly if NICE develops guidance on them.

[Academic Health Science Networks](http://www.ahsnnetwork.com/) (AHSNs) are a gateway for industry into the NHS. They are based on partnership working and collaboration between the NHS, academia, the private sector and other external partners.

AHSNs present a unique opportunity to align education, clinical research, informatics, innovation, training and education, and healthcare delivery. They support knowledge exchange networks and provide support for rapid evaluation and early adoption of innovation.

The government also has up to 50 billion GBP available to support finance and insurance for   supplies from within the UK to buyers outside the UK. This support takes the form of guarantees, insurance and loans issued by its export credit agency, [UK Export Finance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/inward-investment-access-to-the-uks-export-credit-agency).
