The UK provides a very attractive tax regime for regional or global manufacturing. Tax incentives make it easier to reinvest in your next generation research and development. We offer:

- low rates of tax, with headline corporation tax rate falling to 17% by 2020
- innovation incentives (R&D tax relief and Patent Box) which can be utilised by product developers and their R&D, clinical or manufacturing partners
- one of the most comprehensive global treaty networks

The combination of low tax rates and Patent Box could deliver an Effective Tax Rate (ETR) of 11% to 13%.
