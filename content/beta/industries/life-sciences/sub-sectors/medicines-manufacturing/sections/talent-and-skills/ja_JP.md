### Pharmaceutical expertise 

The UK’s pharmaceutical services sector has well-respected expertise and an excellent track record. The pharmaceuticals sector alone now accounts for more UK-based business research and development than any other manufacturing sector. This now makes up more than 20% of all business research and development. 

All of the leading pharmaceutical corporations operating in the global market have a presence in the UK. Two of the top 10 global pharmaceutical companies (GSK and AZ) also have their headquarters here. 

### Proficiency in advanced therapy medicinal products

The UK is renowned for its knowledge and resources for ataxia telangiectasia mutated products and services, such as cell and gene therapies or tissue-engineered products. 

To help your business grow, we support innovative manufacturing processes and technologies, giving you the significant skills base to deliver in this very knowledge-intensive area.

Small molecules still dominate the world’s medicines market. For new chemical entities, the UK is very competitive in ‘novel drug delivery mechanisms’, ‘tricky formulation’ and ‘continuous manufacturing’. 

### Global pipeline opportunities

The global pipeline of biological therapies is rapidly increasing, and there is a growing market for biosimilars and biobetters (variants of a biologic molecule) with some leading biological drugs coming off patent. The majority of the top 15 pharmaceutical companies are expected to grow their biologics portfolios, while injectable dose formulations are likely to spur Contract Manufacturing Organisation growth. The UK has strengths in both areas.
