Any company with a UK branch or office must pay UK Corporation Tax on company profits. The [current Corporation Tax rate is 19%](https://www.gov.uk/corporation-tax-rates/rates), reducing to 17% by 2020. At the current rate of 19%, the UK has the lowest headline business tax rate in the G20.

## Tax on sales

Value Added Tax (VAT) must be charged and paid on goods and services. UK VAT is charged at 20%, although [there are some exceptions](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/rates-of-vat-on-different-goods-and-services). UK businesses that sell goods or services charge VAT on sales and customers who are themselves registered for VAT will be able to [recover VAT paid out](https://www.gov.uk/reclaim-vat).

VAT is not applied to most export transactions, although it is likely to apply to sales to non-VAT registered businesses and private individuals within other EU countries. 

## Tax on imports

Imports into the UK (and other EU countries) from non-EU countries have import duty charged on goods but not services.
