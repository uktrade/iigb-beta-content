By incorporating a company, you’ll create a separate legal entity in the UK, which is known as a private limited company.

The process to [register (incorporate) a private limited company in the UK](https://www.gov.uk/register-a-company-online) is straightforward and typically takes less than 24 hours.
 
**Before you start the process, you’ll need:**

- a name for the company
- an address, which can be any UK address, to act as the registered address of the company
- at least one director (does not need to be UK resident)
- at least one shareholder (can be corporate or an individual)
 
A UK company must have a Memorandum and Articles of Association. These documents must be in place at the time of incorporation. You can select standard documents at the date of incorporation, or professional advisers can prepare and file tailored documents on your company’s behalf.

While it is not a legal requirement to have a UK resident director or shareholder to set up a UK company, many banks will prefer this before they will [open a UK business bank account](/us/setup-guide/open-a-business-account/) for your business.
