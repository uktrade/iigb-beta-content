title: "Register a UK branch of a foreign company"
---
By registering a branch in the UK, a foreign company does not create a separate legal entity but is registering a foreign entity to do business in the UK. A branch does not offer the limited liability benefits that come with a UK company. 

This is known as the [registration of a UK establishment of an overseas company.](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/register-a-uk-establishment-of-an-overseas-company-os-in01)

It will take longer to register a UK branch because the foreign registering company must submit additional documents and information to Companies House. The review process for this can take up to 4 weeks.
