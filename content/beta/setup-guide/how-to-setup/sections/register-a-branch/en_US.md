title: "Register a UK branch of a foreign company"
---

By registering a branch of your company in the UK, your company does not create a separate legal entity, instead it registers your company  to do business in the UK. A branch does not offer the limited liability benefits that come from setting up a UK limited company.

It takes longer to register a UK branch of an overseas company because your company must submit documents and information to Companies House and it can take 4 weeks for these to be reviewed.
