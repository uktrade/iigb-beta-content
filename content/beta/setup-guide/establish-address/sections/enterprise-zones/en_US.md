Enterprise Zones offer a broad range of support to help businesses establish and expand in the UK. There are over 50 existing or planned zones in England and Wales, with 16 Enterprise Areas in Scotland and several in Northern Ireland.

Businesses in these locations can benefit from simplified planning application processes, various financial advantages and a business-ready infrastructure.
