The UK has a wide range of properties for lease or rent for business purposes.

Small companies and entrepreneurs often opt for serviced offices to take advantage of the flexibility they offer in terms of infrastructure (such as internet access) and rental agreement lengths. 
 
Larger companies may want to build, extend or change the use of premises. The UK has a straightforward planning process and one of Europe’s most efficient procedures for obtaining construction permits. Local planning authorities approve almost 90% of planning applications and 75% are completed within 3 months.

There are sites across the UK with existing planning permission, which can reduce the time needed to set up your premises. These are called Enterprise Zones and have simplified planning laws.

## Regional centres of excellence

London is the second-largest capital city in Europe, and businesses thrive in areas all around the country. 

### Business clusters
Businesses from the same or complementary industry sectors have come together as centres of excellence and innovation across the UK. Locating your business in a relevant cluster could help you to:

- access a larger pool of skilled labour
- improve your supply chains
- allow you to share knowledge, ideas, research and development costs 

### Enterprise Zones
Enterprise Zones offer a broad range of support to help businesses establish and expand in the UK. There are over 50 existing or planned zones in England and Wales, with a further 16 Enterprise Areas in Scotland. 

Businesses in these locations can benefit from simplified planning application processes, various financial advantages and a business-ready infrastructure.
