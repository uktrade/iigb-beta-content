title: "Business clusters"
---
Businesses from the same or complementary industries are often located together in business clusters as centres of excellence and innovation across the UK. 

Locating your business in a relevant UK business cluster could help you to:
* access a larger pool of skilled labour
* improve your supply chains
* share knowledge, ideas, research and development costs

Examples of clusters are the Thames Valley for [Motorsport](https://invest.great.gov.uk/int/industries/automotive/motorsport/) and the Midlands for [aerospace](https://invest.great.gov.uk/int/industries/aerospace/).

It's worth determining the advantages of locating in or near an existing UK business cluster.
