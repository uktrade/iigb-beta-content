The UK has a wide range of properties for lease or rent for business purposes.

Small companies and entrepreneurs often opt for serviced offices to take advantage of the flexibility they offer in terms of infrastructure (such as internet access) and rental agreement lengths.
 
Larger companies may want to build, extend or change the use of premises. The UK has a straightforward planning process and one of Europe’s most efficient procedures for obtaining construction permits. Local planning authorities approve almost 90% of planning applications and 75% are completed within 3 months.

There are sites called Enterprise Zones across the UK with existing planning permission, which can reduce the time and cost needed to set up your premises.
