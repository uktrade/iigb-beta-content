The UK operates a National Minimum Wage to encourage people to work and prevent businesses from using low wages to compete unfairly.
 
There's also a National Living Wage, which applies to those aged 25 and over.

[National Insurance](https://www.gov.uk/national-insurance/overview) must be paid for (or in respect of) all employees. As an employer you'll have to pay 13.8% in addition to the 12% payable by employees for earnings over 112 GBP per week.
