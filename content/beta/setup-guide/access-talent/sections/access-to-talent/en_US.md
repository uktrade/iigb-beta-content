Businesses operating in the UK can take advantage of a broad talent base. The UK is second only to the USA for growing, retaining and attracting talent.

There is a wide range of recruitment companies that can search for and select experienced talent. Universities and apprenticeships can help you hire the right people with the right qualifications and training.

### Graduate talent in the UK
The UK is home to 4 of the top 10 universities in the world and has the highest number of leading MBA institutions in Europe. This provides access to a large pool of work-ready graduates.

### UK apprenticeships schemes
An apprenticeship is a job with training that allows apprentices to earn while they work towards a nationally recognised qualification. Apprenticeships last 1 to 5 years and are available in 1,500 occupations across 170 industries.

Apprenticeships enable businesses to grow their own talent, and develop a motivated, skilled, and qualified workforce and reduce staff turnover. They support companies’ competitive edge, productivity and competition in the UK and internationally. In addition, employers do not pay National Insurance contributions for apprentices aged under 25 years. The National Apprenticeship Service can provide free and impartial advice on setting up an apprenticeship programme.

The UK plans to create [3 million apprenticeships by 2020](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/apprenticeships-in-england-vision-for-2020), enabling businesses to grow their talent with motivated and skilled workers. Support for businesses seeking to recruit and train apprentices is available via the [National Apprenticeship Service](http://www.getingofar.gov.uk/employers).
