The UK’s privacy and data protection laws ensure that customer data is processed, held and disposed of fairly, legally, accurately and securely. Your business must abide by the UK’s Data Protection Act. 

Stronger legal protections are in place for sensitive information such as ethnic background, political or religious belief, health records and criminal records.

[Read the Data Protection Act](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/29/contents) for details on how this may be relevant for your business.
