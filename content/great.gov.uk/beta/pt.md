# Beta on www.great.gov.uk

The ‘beta’ label means you’re looking at the first version of a new service or web page.

## Beta services

www.great.gov.uk regularly launches new or redesigned digital services. During the beta phase services are continually tested and improved.

The beta label is displayed on a new service to show it’s being tested - it may not work for everyone.

Redesigned services should be easier to use than the services they replace.

Sometimes a beta service will be available at the same time as an older, existing service - you can choose which one to use.

Successful beta services eventually become ‘live’ and replace any older services that perform the same task.

## Beta web pages

Sometimes a new page is published on www.great.gov.uk before the original page on the old website has been removed. The beta label is displayed on the www.great.gov.uk page until the old page is taken down.
